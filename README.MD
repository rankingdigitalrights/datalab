# RDR internal Data Lab

This is the repository for RDR's tech team projects. Currently, it contains

+ 2019 [spreadsheet automation](/clasp-proj/) [[README](/clasp-proj/README.MD)]
+ 2018/2019 data processing [R scripts](/spreadsheets/) for the 2018 and 2019 CSVs
+ 2019 Google Drive file and folder [mapping](/driveMapping/) (*early WIP*)

 All projects are work-in-progress and by no means final. Therefore, this repository is not public and probably will never be. 

 > Contributers are strongly encouraged to use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rankingdigitalrights/datalab/issues) to track bugs and suggest new features.
