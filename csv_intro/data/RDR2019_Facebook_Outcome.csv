The Global Network Initiative Public Report on 2015-2016 Independent Company Assessments (Source 16) makes clear in several places that Facebook adheres to the GNI Principles, of which freedom of expression is one. This commitment to freedom of expression is also reflected in the Facebook Principles (Source 17). Principle 1 of the Facebook Principles ""Freedom to Share and Connect"" states that ""People should have the freedom to share whatever information they want, in any medium and any format, and have the right to connect online with anyone - any person, organization or service - as long as they both consent to the connection."" In addition, Principle 3 ""Free Flow of Information"" provides that ""People should have the freedom to access all of the information made available to them by others. People should also have practical tools that make it easy, quick, and efficient to share and access this information.""",NA

They should have the freedom to share it with anyone they want and take it with them anywhere they want, including removing it from the Facebook Service. People should have the freedom to decide with whom they will share their information, and to set privacy controls to protect those choices. Those controls, however, are not capable of limiting how those who have received information may use it, particularly outside the Facebook Service.""",NA
