This is often referred to as access to historical data and lawful interception, respectively. This is typically used to solve criminal cases, prevent serious security threats or help find missing people.” The company discloses further information on its process for responding to different types of requests.

It is not publicly available, but the company provides some information about this manual on its website: ""The purpose of our Manual on Handling Authority Requests is to ensure proper handling of such authority requests in order to limit the risk that our companies’ networks are being used to impose illegitimate restrictions to privacy or freedom of expression. It covers all four types of authority requests set out above.  It includes requirements relating to:

Organisation – including dedicated function (s), reporting to top management, staffed with qualified personnel
Handling – including checking legal basis and risk of serious human rights impact, challenge and escalation criteria
Consultation with Group – including process for notification in cases posing significant risk
Information – including regular updates to company CEO
Record keeping – including legal basis and process steps taken
Risk assessment & mitigation – including regular reviews of legal frameworks, update of processes, and long-term strategies to minimise negative impact.""

Telenor provides additional information on requests received by Norwegian authorities (Source 25, p.7): “In Norway, only the Police or the Police Security Service (PST) can carry out interception of communications to investigate serious crimes or national security related offences. Generally they may only do so under a court order issued by a district court, but interceptions without a court order are allowed in a few tightly defined scenarios. Access to communications data is governed by similar rules. There is regulatory oversight of the activities of the police, and parliamentary oversight over the PST and other intelligence agencies.”
