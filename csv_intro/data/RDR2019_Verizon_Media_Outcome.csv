Tumblr also provides a number of other ways for users to submit reports about actions that might affect users' freedom of expression, but these mechanisms are limited to certain types of actions. For instance, Tumblr’s support form offers a list of different topics for users to ask questions on different topics. Note that asking questions is not the same as complaint mechanism, as outlined in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Tumblr also has a help page, which states, “If you believe your post or blog was removed in error, please contact us here.” This allows users to appeal when they feel their blog was removed in error but this is not the same as a general mechanism for users to file a grievance if they feel Tumblr has violated their freedom of expression rights.

When a user submits a valid DMCA counter-notification, we remove the associated strike from their record.” Tumblr also provides users with links in its Community Guidelines for reporting various violations.
