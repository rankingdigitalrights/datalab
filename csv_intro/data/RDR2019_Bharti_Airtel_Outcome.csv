The Fair Usage Policy describes how the company manages the network. The policy does not explicitly commit to not undertaking certain network management practices, but it does describe different usage being based on the package purchased. See: ""airtel sets a monthly data transfer limit, this is different for different plans. Once you reach your data transfer limit, your speed will reduce as stated in your plan. Of course, at the start of your next monthly billing cycle, your monthly speed/ data transfer limit will be reset. Also during the month, you can continue to use the data all you want, there are no additional data transfer caps set by airtel. Data transfers continue to be unlimited as they always were"" (Source 10).",NA

The intent of Airtel's Fair Usage Policy is to provide the optimum internet experience to all customers.'' The company further explains how the policy works: ''Under the policy we have defined fair usage levels for unlimited data transfer plans and needless to mention, the usage levels set are very generous such that most customers will not be affected by the Fair Usage Policy.
On reaching the fair usage level, the plan speed would be rationalized downwards for the rest of the monthly billing cycle. You would also be communicated via email that the speeds for the rest of the billing cycle month would be as per the Airtel’s Fair Usage Policy.
