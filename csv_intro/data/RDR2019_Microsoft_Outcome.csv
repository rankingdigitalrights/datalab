On the page ""About our practices and your data"" (Source 20), the company states, ""Microsoft receives legal demands for customer data from civil litigation parties around the world. Microsoft does not respond to private requests other than those received through a valid legal process. Microsoft adheres to the same principles for all requests from civil proceeding legal requests as it does for government agencies requests for user data, requiring nongovernmental civil litigants to follow the applicable laws, rules and procedures for requesting customer data. If a nongovernmental party wants customer data, it needs to follow applicable legal process — meaning, it must serve us with a valid subpoena or court order for content or subscriber information or other noncontent data."" Therefore it is implied that the company includes court orders in its transparency report, covering both civil and criminal cases, so full credit is given.",NA
