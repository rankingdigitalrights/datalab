        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> This indicator seeks evidence that the company has strong governance and

        over freedom of expression and information and privacy issues at all levels of its operations. Companies should
        clearly
        disclose that senior leadership—from the board to management level—oversees and is accountable for its policies
        and
        practices affecting these human rights.

        To receive full credit for this indicator, companies need to clearly disclose that at each governance level
        (board,
        executive, managerial), there is clear oversight of both freedom of expression and information, and privacy
        issues.
        At
        the board level, this oversight could include a board of directors or another public explanation of how the
        board
        exercises oversight over these issues. Below board level, it can include a company unit, program, or individual
        that
        reports to the executive or managerial level. The committee, program, team, officer, etc. should specifically
        identify
        freedom of expression and privacy in its description of responsibilities.

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> Indicator G2 evaluates whether a company’s senior leadership commits to
        overseeing
        freedom of expression and privacy issues. This indicator, G3, evaluates if the company discloses whether and how
        these
        commitments are institutionalized across the company. More specifically, this indicator seeks disclosure of
        whether
        and
        how the company helps employees understand the importance of freedom of expression and privacy. When employees
        write
        computer code for a new product, review requests for user data, or answer customer questions about how to use a
        service,
        they act in ways that can directly affect users’ freedom of expression and privacy. We expect companies to
        disclose
        information about whether they provide training that informs employees of their role in respecting human rights
        and
        that
        provides employees with an outlet to voice concerns they have regarding human rights.

        A company can only receive full credit on this indicator if it clearly discloses information about employee
        training
        on
        freedom of expression and information, and privacy, as well as the existence of whistleblower programs
        addressing
        these
        issues. Disclosure should specify that employee training and whistleblower programs cover freedom of expression
        and
        privacy. Companies may still receive credit on this indicator if a company’s whistleblower program does not
        specifically
        mention complaints related to freedom of expression and privacy so long as the company has made commitments to
        these
        principles elsewhere and in a way that makes clear that the company would entertain those complaints through
        their
        whistleblower program.

        to result in harmful effects at scale, such as at the population level or over the course of an individual’s
        lifetime.
        Considering the fact that targeted advertisements are less transparent than other forms of advertisement and
        companies’
        significant financial incentives to deploy the technology quickly, these potential rights harms need to be
        considered in
        risk assessments.

        This indicator examines whether companies disclose if they conduct robust, regular, and accountable human rights
        risk
        assessments of the impact of targeted advertising on users’ fundamental rights to freedom of expression and
        information,
        privacy, and non-discrimination. These assessments should be part of the company’s formal, systematic due
        diligence
        activities that are aimed at ensuring that a company’s decisions and practices do not cause, contribute to, or
        exacerbate human rights harms. Assessments enable companies to identify possible risks of targeted advertising
        policies
        and practices on users’ human rights and to take steps to mitigate possible harms if they are identified.

        Note that this indicator does not expect companies to publish detailed results of their human rights impact
        assessments,
        since assessments may include sensitive information. Rather, it expects that companies should disclose that they
        conduct
        HRIAs and provide information on what their HRIA process encompasses.

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> There are a variety of ways in which algorithmic systems may pose harms to
        human
        rights. The development of such systems can rely on user information, often without the knowledge or explicit,
        informed
        consent of the data subject, constituting a privacy violation. Such systems can also cause or contribute to
        expression
        and information harms. In addition, the purpose of many algorithmic decision-making systems is to automate the
        personalization of users’ experiences on the basis of collected and inferred user information, which may cause
        or
        contribute to discrimination. Companies should therefore conduct human rights risk assessments related to their
        development and use of algorithms, as recommended by the Council of Europe in its <a
            href="https://search.coe.int/cm/pages/result_details.aspx?objectid=09000016809e1154">Recommendation on the

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> “Zero-rating” refers to programs—which can be offered by both
        telecommunications
        companies and by platforms, in partnership with telecommunications companies—that provide access to certain
        online
        services or platforms without counting against a person’s data plan. Many telecommunications providers,
        including
        RDR-ranked companies, offer such programs, either as the sole provider of the program or in partnership with
        social
        media platforms, such as Facebook’s “Free Basics.” These types of programs are a form of network prioritization
        that
        undermine net neutrality principles—and can trigger a range of other possible human rights harms, including by
        undermining the right to freedom of expression and information. In addition, Global Voices Advox has identified
        Facebook’s Free Basics as “a mechanism for collecting profitable data from users” (<a
            href="https://advox.globalvoices.org/2017/07/27/can-facebook-connect-the-next-billion/">Global Voices,
            2017</a>),
        raising serious privacy concerns about the program. Zero-rating programs can also be discriminatory in the sense
        that
        they prioritize certain types of data over others, either on the basis of the protocol in question (HTTP, HTTPS,
        VoIP,
        etc.) or on the basis of the content (i.e., prioritizing one social networking site over another). This
        discrimination
        (against types of data) can in turn lead to human rights harms that affect people based on their personal
        characteristics, including gender, race or ethnicity, language(s) spoken, and myriad other traits.

        This indicator examines whether companies conduct robust, regular, and accountable impact assessments of the
        effects
        of
        zero-rating programs on users’ human rights. Companies that offer such programs should conduct assessments of
        how
        these
        programs may impact users’ rights to expression and information, privacy, and non-discrimination. These
        assessments
        should be part of the company’s formal, systematic due diligence activities that are aimed at ensuring that a
        company’s
        decisions and practices do not cause, contribute to, or exacerbate human rights harms. Assessments enable
        companies
        to
        identify possible risks of zero-rating programs and to take steps to mitigate possible harms if they are
        identified.

        Note that this indicator does not expect companies to publish detailed results of their human rights impact

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> This indicator seeks evidence that the company engages with and is
        accountable
        to y
        its stakeholders—particularly with those who face human rights risks in connection with their online activities.
        We
        expect stakeholder engagement to be a core component of a company’s policy development and impact assessment
        process.
        Stakeholder engagement should be carried out across the full range of issues related to users’ freedom of
        expression
        and
        information, privacy, and related rights, including a company’s process for developing terms of service,
        privacy,
        and
        identity policies, as well as algorithmic use policies and policies governing targeted advertising, along with
        the
        enforcement practices for those policies. Stakeholder engagement and accountability mechanisms should include
        the
        full
        range of ways in which users’ rights may be violated: government demands, actions by other third parties via the
        companies’ products and services, or by the companies themselves. Companies that receive full credit on this
        indicator
        will not only engage with stakeholders but also commit to accountability processes such as independent
        assessments
        overseen by a body whose final decisions are not controlled by companies alone.

        Engaging with stakeholders, especially those who operate in high-risk environments, can be sensitive. A company
        may
        not
        feel comfortable publicly disclosing specific details about which stakeholders it consults, where or when they
        meet,
        and
        what they discuss. While we encourage companies to provide details about non-sensitive stakeholder engagement,
        we
        seek,
        at a minimum, public disclosure that a company engages with stakeholders who are or represent users whose rights
        to
        freedom of expression and privacy are at risk. One way the public knows a company participates in this type of
        engagement and that the engagement produces actual results is through its involvement in a multi-stakeholder
        initiative
        whose purpose is not only to create a safe space for engagement, but also to enable companies to make
        commitments,
        support them in meeting them, and hold companies accountable to them. Full and credible accountability
        mechanisms
        require multi-stakeholder governance in which companies alone do not control decision making regarding
        accountability
        processes and engagements, but rather share decision-making authority with representatives of other stakeholder
        constituencies.

        If a company receives full credit on Element 1, it will automatically receive full credit on Element 2 and
        Element
        3.
        Note that because the scope of the Global Network Initiative’s work focuses on government demands, and at least
        half
        of
        RDR’s methodology addresses human rights threats that do not originate from governments, for the 2020 RDR Index
        GNI
        membership (without evidence of engagement and accountability on other human rights risks beyond those posed by
        governments) will only result in partial credit for Element 1 of this indicator.

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> Human rights can only be protected and respected if people have redress
        when
        they
        believe their rights have been violated. This indicator examines whether companies provide such remedy
        mechanisms
        and
        whether they have publicly disclosed processes for responding to grievances from individuals who believe that
        the
        company has violated or directly facilitated violations of their freedom of expression or privacy.

        We expect companies to clearly disclose a grievance mechanism enabling users to submit complaints if they feel
        their
        freedom of expression and privacy have been infringed by the company’s policies or practices. To receive full
        credit
        on
        Element 1, a company’s grievance mechanism does not have to explicitly state that it applies to freedom of
        expression
        and privacy related complaints. However it should be clear that this mechanism can be used to file any type of
        human
        rights-related grievance. We also expect a company’s grievance mechanism to be clearly accessible to users. In
        addition,
        the company should explain its process for providing remedy to these types of complaints, and disclose evidence
        of
        doing
        so. Companies should describe clear timelines for addressing each stage of the grievance and remedy processes.
        These
        standards are outlined in Principle 31 of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which states
        that
        businesses should publish clear, accessible, and predictable remedy procedures.

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> No matter how carefully a platform crafts its terms of service, mistakes
        are
        inevitable in the demanding and subjective endeavor of content moderation. This is particularly true when
        content
        moderation is scaled rapidly through the use of automation. To respect users’ freedom of expression and
        information
        rights, companies should provide a robust and transparent appeals system that enables users to appeal decisions
        made
        by
        the company that directly influence users’ ability to exercise these rights. Companies should clearly disclose
        their
        process for appealing content moderation actions, including enabling affected users to immediately appeal that
        action. A
        robust appeals process should include oversight by a human reviewer and give affected users an opportunity to
        present
        additional information. Companies should also offer a clear timeframe for reviewing appeals and clearly disclose
        the
        circumstances in which appeals are not possible.

        To receive full credit on this indicator, companies should inform users how to submit an appeal and describe
        what
        happens once the appeal enters the pipeline. This includes notifying users of their options for appeal as soon
        as
        the
        company takes an initial action on their content, clarifying the role of both automation and independent human
        moderators in the appeals process, clearly disclosing the reason for an appeals decision and the timeframes
        involved,
        and specifying circumstances in which the appeals process is not available. Companies should also clearly
        demonstrate
        they respond to appeals by publishing data on the appeals received and the outcome of those decisions.

    <div class="guidance">

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> A company’s terms of service outline the relationship between the user and
        the
        company. These terms contain rules about prohibited content and activities, and companies can also take action
        against
        users for violating the rules described in the terms. Given this, we expect companies to ensure that the terms
        are
        easy
        to access and understand.

        This indicator evaluates if the company’s terms are easy for users to locate. A document that is easy to find is
        located
        on the homepage of the company or service, or one or two clicks away from the homepage, or in a logical place
        where
        users can expect to find it. The use of positioning or colour schemes that make a text or link less noticeable,
        or
        hard
        to find on a webpage, means that the document is not easily accessible. The terms of service of an app should
        never
        be
        more than “two taps away” within the app (e.g. by including a “Privacy”/“Data Protection” option in the menu
        functionality of the app). The terms should also be available in the major language(s) of the primary operating
        market.
        In addition, we expect a company to take steps to help users understand the information presented in their
        documents.
        This includes, but is not limited to, providing summaries, tips, or guidance that explain what the terms mean,
        using
        section headers, readable font size, or other graphical features to help users understand the document, or
        writing
        the
        terms using readable syntax.

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> Companies that enable any type of advertising on their services or
        platforms
        should
        clearly disclose the rules for what types of ad content is prohibited—for example, ads that discriminate against
        individuals or groups based on personal attributes like age, religion, gender, and ethnicity. Companies should
        be
        transparent about these rules so that both users and advertisers can understand what types of ad content are not
        permissible and so they can be accountable for the ad content that appears on their services or platforms.
        Therefore, companies should make these rules easy to find (E1), easy to understand (E3), and available in the
        main
        languages of the company’s home market (E2). Companies that operate mobile ecosystems (Apple iOS, Google
        Android,
        and
        Samsung’s implementation of Android) and personal digital assistant ecosystems (Amazon’s Alexa, Alibaba’s
        AliGenie)
        should enable users to choose which apps or skills to download on the basis of their participation (or not) in
        advertising networks. Therefore, Element 4 and Element 5 ask whether the company discloses a requirement for
        apps or
        skills made available through its app store or skills store to provide users with an advertising content policy.

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> In addition to providing accessible ad content policies (Indicator F1b),
        companies
        should also clearly disclose their ad targeting policies. The ability for advertisers or other third parties to
        target
        users with tailored content—based on their browsing behaviors, location information, and other data and
        characteristics
        that have been inferred about them—can significantly shape (or in some cases, distort) a user’s online
        ecosystem.
        Targeting, which can include both paid and unpaid content, can amplify offline social inequities and can be
        overtly
        discriminatory. It can also result in so-called “filter bubbles” as well as amplify problematic content,
        including
        content intended to mislead or to spread falsehoods.
        Therefore, companies that enable advertisers and other third parties to target their users with tailored ads or
        content
        should publish targeting policies that users can easily find and understand, and that are available in the main
        languages of the company’s home market. Users should be able to access and understand these rules in order to
        make
        informed decisions using the information about the ad content they are receiving. For mobile ecosystems and
        personal
        digital assistant ecosystems, companies should disclose a requirement for apps or skills made available through
        their

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> The use of algorithmic systems can have adverse effects on fundamental
        human
        rights—and specifically, on the right to freedom of expression and information as well as the right to
        non-discrimination. In addition to clearly committing to respect and protect human rights as they develop and
        deploy
        these technologies (see Indicator G1, Element 3), companies should also publish policies that clearly describe
        the
        terms
        for how they use algorithmic systems across their service and platforms. Similar to having terms of service
        policies
        or
        user agreements that outline the terms for what types of content or activities are prohibited, companies that
        use
        algorithmic systems with the potential to cause human rights harms should publish a clear and accessible policy
        stating
        the nature and functions of these systems. As recommended by the Council of Europe’s <a

        language,
        and contains options for users to manage settings.
        Note that in this indicator, we are looking for a policy that explains terms for how the company deploys
        algorithmic
        systems across its platforms and services. We also look for companies to disclose terms that outline how they

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> It is common for companies to change their terms of service as their
        business
        evolves. However these changes, which can include rules about prohibited content and activities, can have a
        significant
        impact on users’ freedom of expression and information rights. We therefore expect companies to commit to
        notifying
        users when they change these terms and to providing users with information that helps them understand what these
        changes
        mean.

        This indicator evaluates whether companies clearly disclose the method and timeframe for notifying users about
        changes
        to their terms of service. We expect companies to commit to directly notifying users of these changes prior to
        changes
        coming into effect. The method of direct notification may differ according to the type of service; we expect
        companies
        to directly notify users in a way that users are sure to access. For services that contain user accounts, direct
        notification may involve sending an email or an SMS. For services that do not require a user account, direct
        notification may involve posting a prominent notice where users access that service. This indicator also seeks
        evidence
        that a company provides publicly available records of previous terms so that people can understand how the

    </div>
    <div class="guidance">

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> It is fair to expect companies to set rules prohibiting certain content or
        activities—like toxic speech or malicious behavior. However, when companies develop and enforce rules about what
        people
        can do and say on the internet—or whether they can access a service at all—they must do so in a way that is
        transparent
        and accountable.

        We therefore expect companies to clearly disclose what these rules are and how they enforce them. This includes
        information about how companies learn of material or activities that violate their terms. For example, companies
        may
        rely on outside contractors to review content and/or user activity. They may also rely on community flagging
        mechanisms
        that allow users to flag other users’ content and/or activity for company review. They may also deploy
        algorithmic
        systems to detect and flag breaches, in which case, companies should explain how these systems are used and on
        what
        types of content. We expect companies to clearly disclose whether they have a policy of granting priority or
        expedited
        consideration to any government authorities and/or members of private organizations or other entities that
        identify
        their organizational affiliation when they report content or users for allegedly violating the company’s rules.
        For
        mobile ecosystems, we expect companies to disclose the types of apps they would restrict. For personal digital
        assistant
        ecosystems, we expect companies to disclose the types of skills and search results they would restrict. In this
        disclosure, the company should also provide examples to help users understand what these rules mean.

        inferred about them—can significantly shape a user’s online ecosystem. Targeting, which can include both paid
        and
        unpaid
        content, can amplify offline social inequities and can be overtly discriminatory. It can also result in
        so-called
        “filter bubbles,” as well as spread problematic content, including content intended to mislead or to spread
        falsehoods.

        Therefore, companies that enable advertisers and other third parties to target their users with tailored ads or
        content
        should have clear policies describing their ad targeting rules. Companies should clearly disclose whether they
        enable
        third parties to target their users with tailored ads or other types of sponsored content , and clearly disclose
        what
        targeting parameters—like using certain types of audience categories, like age, location, or other user
        characteristics—are not permitted . Companies should also disclose their processes for identifying breaches to
        targeting
        rules .

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong>In addition to demands from governments and other types of authorities,
        companies
        can receive requests to remove or restrict access to content and accounts through private processes. These types

        Millennium
        Copyright Act, the European Right to be Forgotten ruling, etc.) or via self-regulatory arrangements (e.g.,

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> Companies frequently receive demands from governments to remove, filter, or
        restrict content or accounts. We expect companies- to regularly publish data about the number and type of
        government
        demands it receives, and the number of such requests with which it complies. Companies may receive these demands
        through
        official processes, such as with a court order, or through informal channels, like through a company’s flagging
        system
        intended to allow private individuals to report content that violates the terms of service. Companies should be
        transparent about the nature of these requests. If a company knows that a request is coming from a government
        entity
        or
        court, the company should disclose it as part of its government requests reporting. Disclosing this data helps
        the
        public gain a greater understanding of the relationship between companies and governments in policing content
        online,
        and helps the public hold companies and governments accountable for their obligations to respect and protect
        freedom
        of
        expression rights.

        In some cases, the law might prevent a company from disclosing information referenced in this indicator’s
        elements.
        For
        example, we expect companies to publish exact numbers rather than ranges of numbers. We acknowledge that laws
        sometimes
        prevent companies from doing so, and researchers will document situations where this is the case. But a company
        will
        nonetheless lose points if it fails to meet the standards specified in all of the above elements. This
        represents a
        situation where the law causes companies to fall short of best practice, and we encourage companies to advocate

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> Indicator F3 examines company disclosure of restrictions on what users can
        post
        or
        do on a service. This indicator, F8, focuses on whether a company clearly discloses that it notifies users when
        it
        takes
        these types of actions (whether due to terms of service enforcement or third-party restriction requests). A
        company’s
        decision to restrict or remove access to content or accounts can have a significant impact on users’ freedom of
        expression and access to information rights. We therefore expect a company to disclose that they notify users
        when
        they
        have removed content, restricted a user’s account, or otherwise restricted users’ abilities to access a service.
        If
        a
        company removes content that a user has posted, we expect the company to inform that user about its decision. If
        a
        different user attempts to access content that the company has restricted, we expect the company to notify that
        user
        about the content restriction. We also expect companies to specify reasons for their decisions. This disclosure
        should
        be part of companies’ explanations of their content and access restriction practices.

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong>Network shutdowns are a growing threat to human rights. The U.N. Human

        Council has condemned network shutdowns as a violation of international human rights law and called on

        to
        refrain from taking these actions. Yet governments are increasingly ordering telecommunications companies to
        shut
        down
        their networks, which in turn puts pressure on companies to take actions that violate their responsibility to
        respect

    <div class="guidance">

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> The ability to communicate anonymously is essential to freedom of
        expression
        both
        on and offline. The use of a real name online, or requiring users to provide a company with identifying
        information,
        provides a link between online activities and a specific person. This presents human rights risks to those
        who,
        for
        example, voice opinions that don’t align with a government’s views or who engage in activism that a
        government
        does
        not
        permit. It also presents risks for people who are persecuted for religious beliefs or sexual orientation.

        We therefore expect companies to disclose whether they might ask users to verify their identities using
        government-issued ID or other forms of identification that could be connected to their offline identity.
        Other
        forms
        of
        identification can include credit cards and registered phone numbers. We acknowledge that users may have to
        provide
        information that could be connected to their offline identity in order to access paid features of various
        products
        and
        services. However, users should be able to access features that don’t require payment without needing to
        provide
        information that can be tied to their offline identity. In some cases, phone numbers can be connected to a
        user’s
        offline identity, for example, in legal contexts where prepaid users are required to register with their
        IDs.
        When
        providing a phone number is necessary to the provision of the service (for example in the case of instant
        messaging
        apps), companies should receive full credit, unless they also require users to use their real names or
        submit
        documents
        that would tie their names to their offline identities. Services that require users to provide a phone
        number
        for
        purposes not necessary to the provision of the service will receive no credit: for example, some services
        may
        require
        phone numbers for two-factor authentication purposes, however, this should be optional and users should be
        provided
        with
        other two-factor authentication options.

        are
        optimized for user engagement can have the effect of prioritizing controversial and inflammatory content,
        including
        content that is not protected under international human rights law. Over time, reliance on algorithmic
        curation
        and
        recommendation systems that are optimized for engagement can alter the news and information ecosystems of
        entire

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> Social media platforms often allow users to create automated software
        agents,
        or
        “bots,” that automate various actions a user account can take, such as posting or boosting content
        (re-tweeting,
        for
        example). There are many innocuous or even positive uses of bots—for instance, artists use Twitter bots for
        the
        purpose
        of parody. There are also more problematic uses that many companies forbid or discourage, such as when
        political
        parties
        or their surrogates use botnets to promote certain messages or to artificially inflate a candidate’s reach
        in
        order
        to
        manipulate public discourse and outcomes. On some social media platforms, bots or coordinated networks of
        bots
        (“botnets”) can be used to harass users (“brigading”), artificially amplify certain pieces of content (mass
        retweeting,
        etc), and otherwise distort public discourse on the platform. Some experts have called for companies to
        require
        users
        who use bots to explicitly label them as bots, in order to help detect such distortions.

        Companies that allow bots therefore should have clear policies governing the use of bots on their platforms.
        They
        should
        disclose whether they require content and accounts that are produced, disseminated or operated with the
        assistance
        of a
        bot to be labelled as such. They should also clarify their process for enforcing their bot policies,
        including
        by
        publishing data on the volume and nature of content and accounts that are restricted for violating these
        rules.

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> Privacy policies address how companies collect, manage, use, and secure
        information
        about users as well as information provided by users. Given this, companies should ensure that users can
        easily
        locate
        this policy and to make an effort to help users understand what they mean. This indicator expects companies
        to
        publish
        privacy policies that are easy to find, are available in the primary languages spoken in the company’s home
        market,
        and
        easy to understand. If the company offers multiple products and services, it should be clear to what
        products
        and
        services the privacy policies applies.

        A document that is “easy to find” should be easily accessible from the company’s homepage or service
        website. It
        should
        be located a few clicks away from the homepage, or otherwise accessible in a logical place where users are
        likely to
        find it. The terms should also be available in the major language(s) of the home market. In addition, we
        expect
        a
        company to take steps to help users understand the information presented in their policies. This may
        include,
        but is
        not
        limited to, providing summaries, tips, or guidance that explain what the terms mean, using section headers,

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> Companies frequently change their privacy policies as their business
        evolves.
        However,
        these changes can affect a user’s privacy rights by changing what user information companies can collect,
        share, and store. We therefore expect companies to commit to notifying users when they change these policies
        and

        privacy policies. We expect companies to commit to directly notifying users prior to changes coming into
        effect.
        The
        method of direct notification may differ based on the type of service. For services that require a user
        account,
        direct notification may involve sending an email or an SMS. For services that do not require a user account,
        direct
        notification should involve posting a prominent notice on the main webpage or platform where users access

        service.

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> Companies collect a wide range of personal information from users—from
        personal
        details and account profiles to a user’s activities and location. We expect companies to clearly disclose
        what
        user
        information they collect and how they do so. We also expect companies to commit to the principle of data
        minimization
        and to demonstrate how this principle shapes their practices regarding user information. If companies
        collect
        multiple
        types of information, we expect them to provide details on how they handle each type of information. For
        mobile
        ecosystems and personal digital assistant (PDA) ecosystems, we expect the company to clearly disclose
        whether
        the
        privacy policies of the apps or PDA skills that are available in its mobile app store or PDA skill store
        specify
        what
        user information the apps or skills collect and whether those policies comply with data minimization
        principles.

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> In addition to collecting information about users, companies also
        perform
        big
        data
        analytics to make inferences, or predictions, about users on the basis of the collected information. These
        methods
        might
        be used to make inferences about user preferences or attributes (such as race, gender, sexual orientation),
        and
        opinions
        (including political opinions), or to predict consumer behaviors. Without sufficient transparency and user
        control
        over
        data inference, privacy-invasive and non-verifiable inferences cannot be predicted, understood, or refuted
        by
        users.<strong>Indicator guidance:</strong>

        In addition to disclosing the information that they collect, companies should disclose what information they
        infer
        and
        how they infer it. They should also commit to only infer information that is relevant and necessary to
        provide
        the
        service. For example, companies should not try to infer their users’ religion, sexual orientation,
        or health status (such as by assigning them to an audience category based on this characteristic) unless
        that
        information is somehow directly necessary to accomplish the purpose of their service.

        retain
        certain
        information for a given period of time. In these cases, companies should clearly disclose these regulations
        to
        users.
        Companies that choose to retain user information for extended periods of time should also take steps to
        ensure
        that
        data
        is not tied to a specific user. Acknowledging the ongoing debates about the efficacy of de-identification
        processes,
        and
        the growing sophistication around re-identification practices, we still consider de-identification a
        positive
        step
        that
        companies can take to protect the privacy of their users.

        In addition, if companies collect multiple types of information, we expect them to clearly disclose for how
        long
        they
        retain each type of information. For mobile ecosystems and personal digital assistant (PDA) ecosystems, we
        expect
        companies to disclose whether the privacy policies of the mobile apps and PDA skills that are available in
        their
        app
        and
        skill store state how long the app or skill retains user information and whether all user information is
        deleted
        if
        users terminate or delete the app or the skill.

    <div class="guidance">

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> We expect companies to clearly disclose what options users have to
        control
        the
        information that companies collect, retain, and infer about them. Enabling users to control what information
        about
        them
        that a company collects, infers, and retains would mean giving users the ability to delete specific types of
        user
        information without requiring them to delete their entire account. We therefore expect companies to clearly
        disclose
        whether users have the option to delete specific types of user information. In addition, we expect companies
        to
        enable
        users to control the use of their information for the purpose of targeted advertising and algorithmic system
        development. Targeted advertising requires extensive collection, retention, and inference of user
        information,
        and companies should therefore clearly disclose whether users have options to control how their information
        is
        being
        used for these purposes.

        For mobile ecosystems and personal digital assistant (PDA) ecosystems, we expect companies to clearly
        disclose
        what
        options users have to control the collection of their location information. A user’s location changes
        frequently
        and
        many users carry their mobile devices nearly everywhere, making the collection of this type of information
        particularly
        sensitive. In addition, the location settings on mobile ecosystems and personal digital assistant ecosystems
        can
        influence how other products and services access their location information. For instance,
        mobile apps or PDA ecosystem skills may enable users to control location information. However, if the device
        on
        which
        those mobile apps or PDA skills run collects geolocation data by default and does not give users a way to
        turn
        this
        off,
        users may not be able to limit mobile apps’ or PDA skills’ collection of their location information. For
        these
        reasons,
        we expect companies to disclose that users can control how their device interacts with their location
        information.

        to
        access
        the list of advertising categories that they have been assigned to. In order to target ads, companies
        typically

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> Companies increasingly receive government demands to turn over user
        information.
        These demands can come from government agencies or courts (both domestic and foreign). We expect companies
        to
        publicly
        disclose their process for responding to demands from governments, along with the basis for complying with
        these
        requests. Companies should also publicly commit to pushing back on inappropriate or overbroad government
        demands.

        In some cases, the law might prevent a company from disclosing information referenced in this indicator’s
        elements.
        Researchers will document situations where this is the case, but a company will still lose points if it
        fails to
        meet
        standards for all elements. This represents a situation where the law causes companies to fall short of best
        practice,
        and we encourage companies to advocate for laws that enable them to fully respect users’ rights to freedom
        of
        expression

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> Companies frequently receive demands from governments to hand over user
        information. These demands can come from government agencies or courts (both domestic and foreign). We
        expect
        companies
        to regularly publish data about the number and type of such demands they receive, and the number of such
        demands
        with
        which they comply. Companies should disclose data about requests they receive by country, including from
        their
        home
        and
        foreign governments, as well as from law enforcement and courts. We also expect company disclosure to
        indicate
        the
        number of accounts affected by these demands and to delineate by category the demands with which the company
        has
        complied. We recognize that companies are sometimes not legally allowed to disclose demands for user
        information
        made by
        governments. However, in these cases, we expect companies to report what types of government demands they
        are
        not
        allowed to disclose by law. Companies should also report this data once a year and should ensure the data
        can be

        In some cases, the law might prevent a company from disclosing information referenced in this indicator. For
        example,
        we expect companies to publish exact numbers rather than ranges of numbers. We acknowledge that laws

        lose

        <strong>Indicator guidance:</strong> Computer code is not perfect. When companies learn of vulnerabilities
        that
        could
        put users and their information at risk, they should take action to mitigate those concerns. This includes
        ensuring
        that
        people are able to share any vulnerabilities they discover with the company. We believe it is especially
        important
        for
        companies to provide clear policies to users about the manner and time period in which users will receive
        security
        updates. In addition, since telecommunications providers can alter open-source mobile operating systems, we
        expect
        these
        companies to disclose information that may affect a user’s ability to access these critical updates.

        breaches, including clear policies for notifying affected users. Given that data breaches can result in
        significant
        threats to an individual’s financial or personal security, in addition to exposing private information,
        companies
        should
        make these processes publicly available. Individuals can then make informed decisions and consider the
        potential
        risks
        before signing up for a service or giving a company their information.

        We expect companies to have formal policies in place regarding their handling of data breaches if and when

        The U.N. Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression has stated unequivocally that encryption and anonymity
        are

        communications are encrypted by default, that transmissions are protected by “perfect forward secrecy,” that
        users
        have
        an option to turn on end-to-end encryption, and whether it is enabled by default. For mobile ecosystems and
        personal
        digital assistant ecosystems, we expect companies to clearly disclose that they enable full-disk encryption.
