When employees write computer code for a new product, review requests for user data, or answer customer questions about how to use a service, they act in ways that can directly affect users’ freedom of expression and privacy. We expect companies to disclose information about whether they provide training that informs employees of their role in respecting human rights and that provides employees with an outlet to voice concerns they have regarding human rights. A company can only receive full credit on this indicator if it clearly discloses information about employee training on freedom of expression and information, and privacy, as well as the existence of whistleblower programs addressing these issues. Disclosure should specify that employee training and whistleblower programs cover freedom of expression and privacy. Companies may still receive credit on this indicator if a company’s whistleblower program does not specifically mention complaints related to freedom of expression and privacy so long as the company has made commitments to these principles elsewhere and in a way that makes clear that the company would entertain those complaints through their whistleblower program.",

      "guidance": "Targeted advertising can have adverse affects on human rights, specifically on users’ rights to freedom of information, freedom of information, and freedom from discrimination. Discrimination occurs when platforms allow third-party advertisers to show different advertisements to different users on the basis of disclosed and inferred information, including membership in protected categories (race, ethnicity, age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, health, disability, etc.). Discrimination need not be illegal or immediately harmful to result in harmful effects at scale, such as at the population level or over the course of an individual’s lifetime. Considering the fact that targeted advertisements are less transparent than other forms of advertisement and companies’ significant financial incentives to deploy the technology quickly, these potential rights harms need to be considered in risk assessments. This indicator examines whether companies disclose if they conduct robust, regular, and accountable human rights risk assessments of the impact of targeted advertising on users’ fundamental rights to freedom of expression and information, privacy, and non-discrimination.

The development of such systems can rely on user information, often without the knowledge or explicit, informed consent of the data subject, constituting a privacy violation. Such systems can also cause or contribute to expression and information harms. In addition, the purpose of many algorithmic decision-making systems is to automate the personalization of users’ experiences on the basis of collected and inferred user information, which may cause or contribute to discrimination. Companies should therefore conduct human rights risk assessments related to their development and use of algorithms, as recommended by the Council of Europe in its Recommendation on the human rights impacts of algorithmic systems (2020).

      "guidance": "“Zero-rating” refers to programs—which can be offered by both telecommunications companies and by platforms, in partnership with telecommunications companies—that provide access to certain online services or platforms without counting against a person’s data plan. Many telecommunications providers, including RDR-ranked companies, offer such programs, either as the sole provider of the program or in partnership with social media platforms, such as Facebook’s “Free Basics.” These types of programs are a form of network prioritization that undermine net neutrality principles—and can trigger a range of other possible human rights harms, including by undermining the right to freedom of expression and information. In addition, Global Voices Advox has identified Facebook’s Free Basics as “a mechanism for collecting profitable data from users” (Global Voices, 2017), raising serious privacy concerns about the program. Zero-rating programs can also be discriminatory in the sense that they prioritize certain types of data over others, either on the basis of the protocol in question (HTTP, HTTPS, VoIP, etc.) or on the basis of the content (i.e., prioritizing one social networking site over another). This discrimination (against types of data) can in turn lead to human rights harms that affect people based on their personal characteristics, including gender, race or ethnicity, language(s) spoken, and myriad other traits. This indicator examines whether companies conduct robust, regular, and accountable impact assessments of the effects of zero-rating programs on users’ human rights. Companies that offer such programs should conduct assessments of how these programs may impact users’ rights to expression and information, privacy, and non-discrimination. These assessments should be part of the company’s formal, systematic due diligence activities that are aimed at ensuring that a company’s decisions and practices do not cause, contribute to, or exacerbate human rights harms.

We expect stakeholder engagement to be a core component of a company’s policy development and impact assessment process. Stakeholder engagement should be carried out across the full range of issues related to users’ freedom of expression and information, privacy, and related rights, including a company’s process for developing terms of service, privacy, and identity policies, as well as algorithmic use policies and policies governing targeted advertising, along with the enforcement practices for those policies. Stakeholder engagement and accountability mechanisms should include the full range of ways in which users’ rights may be violated: government demands, actions by other third parties via the companies’ products and services, or by the companies themselves. Companies that receive full credit on this indicator will not only engage with stakeholders but also commit to accountability processes such as independent assessments overseen by a body whose final decisions are not controlled by companies alone.

While we encourage companies to provide details about non-sensitive stakeholder engagement, we seek, at a minimum, public disclosure that a company engages with stakeholders who are or represent users whose rights to freedom of expression and privacy are at risk. One way the public knows a company participates in this type of engagement and that the engagement produces actual results is through its involvement in a multi-stakeholder initiative whose purpose is not only to create a safe space for engagement, but also to enable companies to make commitments, support them in meeting them, and hold companies accountable to them. Full and credible accountability mechanisms require multi-stakeholder governance in which companies alone do not control decision making regarding accountability processes and engagements, but rather share decision-making authority with representatives of other stakeholder constituencies. If a company receives full credit on Element 1, it will automatically receive full credit on Element 2 and Element 3. Note that because the scope of the Global Network Initiative’s work focuses on government demands, and at least half of RDR’s methodology addresses human rights threats that do not originate from governments, for the 2020 RDR Index GNI membership (without evidence of engagement and accountability on other human rights risks beyond those posed by governments) will only result in partial credit for Element 1 of this indicator.",

In addition, the company should explain its process for providing remedy to these types of complaints, and disclose evidence of doing so. Companies should describe clear timelines for addressing each stage of the grievance and remedy processes.

Companies should clearly disclose their process for appealing content moderation actions, including enabling affected users to immediately appeal that action. A robust appeals process should include oversight by a human reviewer and give affected users an opportunity to present additional information. Companies should also offer a clear timeframe for reviewing appeals and clearly disclose the circumstances in which appeals are not possible. To receive full credit on this indicator, companies should inform users how to submit an appeal and describe what happens once the appeal enters the pipeline. This includes notifying users of their options for appeal as soon as the company takes an initial action on their content, clarifying the role of both automation and independent human moderators in the appeals process, clearly disclosing the reason for an appeals decision and the timeframes involved, and specifying circumstances in which the appeals process is not available. Companies should also clearly demonstrate they respond to appeals by publishing data on the appeals received and the outcome of those decisions.",

We therefore expect companies to clearly disclose what these rules are and how they enforce them. This includes information about how companies learn of material or activities that violate their terms. For example, companies may rely on outside contractors to review content and/or user activity. They may also rely on community flagging mechanisms that allow users to flag other users’ content and/or activity for company review. They may also deploy algorithmic systems to detect and flag breaches, in which case, companies should explain how these systems are used and on what types of content. We expect companies to clearly disclose whether they have a policy of granting priority or expedited consideration to any government authorities and/or members of private organizations or other entities that identify their organizational affiliation when they report content or users for allegedly violating the company’s rules. For mobile ecosystems, we expect companies to disclose the types of apps they would restrict. For personal digital assistant ecosystems, we expect companies to disclose the types of skills and search results they would restrict.

Companies may receive these demands through official processes, such as with a court order, or through informal channels, like through a company’s flagging system intended to allow private individuals to report content that violates the terms of service. Companies should be transparent about the nature of these requests. If a company knows that a request is coming from a government entity or court, the company should disclose it as part of its government requests reporting. Disclosing this data helps the public gain a greater understanding of the relationship between companies and governments in policing content online, and helps the public hold companies and governments accountable for their obligations to respect and protect freedom of expression rights. In some cases, the law might prevent a company from disclosing information referenced in this indicator’s elements. For example, we expect companies to publish exact numbers rather than ranges of numbers. We acknowledge that laws sometimes prevent companies from doing so, and researchers will document situations where this is the case. But a company will nonetheless lose points if it fails to meet the standards specified in all of the above elements. This represents a situation where the law causes companies to fall short of best practice, and we encourage companies to advocate for laws that enable them to fully respect users’ rights to freedom of expression and privacy.",

It also presents risks for people who are persecuted for religious beliefs or sexual orientation. We therefore expect companies to disclose whether they might ask users to verify their identities using government-issued ID or other forms of identification that could be connected to their offline identity. Other forms of identification can include credit cards and registered phone numbers. We acknowledge that users may have to provide information that could be connected to their offline identity in order to access paid features of various products and services. However, users should be able to access features that don’t require payment without needing to provide information that can be tied to their offline identity. In some cases, phone numbers can be connected to a user’s offline identity, for example, in legal contexts where prepaid users are required to register with their IDs. When providing a phone number is necessary to the provision of the service (for example in the case of instant messaging apps), companies should receive full credit, unless they also require users to use their real names or submit documents that would tie their names to their offline identities. Services that require users to provide a phone number for purposes not necessary to the provision of the service will receive no credit: for example, some services may require phone numbers for two-factor authentication purposes, however, this should be optional and users should be provided with other two-factor authentication options.

There are also more problematic uses that many companies forbid or discourage, such as when political parties or their surrogates use botnets to promote certain messages or to artificially inflate a candidate’s reach in order to manipulate public discourse and outcomes. On some social media platforms, bots or coordinated networks of bots (“botnets”) can be used to harass users (“brigading”), artificially amplify certain pieces of content (mass retweeting, etc), and otherwise distort public discourse on the platform. Some experts have called for companies to require users who use bots to explicitly label them as bots, in order to help detect such distortions. Companies that allow bots therefore should have clear policies governing the use of bots on their platforms. They should disclose whether they require content and accounts that are produced, disseminated or operated with the assistance of a bot to be labelled as such.

For mobile ecosystems and personal digital assistant (PDA) ecosystems, we expect companies to clearly disclose what options users have to control the collection of their location information. A user’s location changes frequently and many users carry their mobile devices nearly everywhere, making the collection of this type of information particularly sensitive. In addition, the location settings on mobile ecosystems and personal digital assistant ecosystems can influence how other products and services access their location information. For instance, mobile apps or PDA ecosystem skills may enable users to control location information. However, if the device on which those mobile apps or PDA skills run collects geolocation data by default and does not give users a way to turn this off, users may not be able to limit mobile apps’ or PDA skills’ collection of their location information.

Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression has stated unequivocally that encryption and anonymity are essential for the exercise and protection of human rights. We expect companies to clearly disclose that user communications are encrypted by default, that transmissions are protected by “perfect forward secrecy,” that users have an option to turn on end-to-end encryption, and whether it is enabled by default. For mobile ecosystems and personal digital assistant ecosystems, we expect companies to clearly disclose that they enable full-disk encryption.",

Companies should present this guidance using clear language, ideally paired with visual materials, designed to help users understand the nature of the risks companies and users can face. These materials can take many forms including tips, tutorials, how-to guides, FAQs, or other resources presented in a way that users can easily understand.",
